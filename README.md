# Weenix-OS
Weenix OS -> Designed and implemented a toy OS kernel

This repository is a placeholder for Weenix Operating System which I implemented as part of the graduate level course, CSCI 402 (Spring 2022), taught at USC by Prof. Bill Cheng.

What we developed?

- Optimized thread creation and ensured efficient memory management throughout the thread lifecycle, including termination.
- Engineered a VFS supporting 20 fundamental file system calls and managing namespaces across various RAMFS and SFS5.
- Formulated a Virtual Memory module responsible for managing user space and system calls, resulting in enhanced execution.

Tech Stack: **C, kernel programming, Linux, gdb.**

My program passed all tests and got full marks including bonus. mail me at chintwa@usc.edu for code
